## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- Tailwind CSS
- Astro.js

### What I learned

I used this challenge to dive into Astro js. It reminds me a bit of Vue.js

### Continued development

This was not a very complicated challenge. The toughest part was probably getting the responsiveness just right, but it allowed me to delve into Astro and its simple templating.
